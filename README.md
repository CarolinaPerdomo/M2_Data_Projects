# M2_Data_Projects :computer:

Projects in data analysis and data science in which I participated during my M2 :bowtie:. In these projects I learned to:

- Understand the problems and translate them analytically.
- Define the rules to structure the data.
- Do analysis and exploration of data with C++ and Python (NumPy).
- Do Data analysis using classical statistical models.
- Do comparison of the data with Monte Carlo models.
- Elaborate graphs to present the results with ROOT and Python.
- Communicate the results of the project thanks to Dataviz tools.

Specifically:

### Situation 1: :information_desk_person: 
- 7 days of scientific mini-project in cosmology & astrophysics.
- Build algorithms for data analysis.
- Context: Planck mission.
- Task: Reconstruct clusters in patches of Planck maps. Separate the signals.
- Action: Linear combination.

- Result: Planck enables us to identify new clusters and superclusters.

### Situation 2: :information_desk_person:
- 5 month internship in particle physics.
- Large scale data analysis.
- Context: ATLAS experiment in the LHC.
- Task: The main task was the characterization of isolation for photons. Data and Monte Carlo simulations were compared for and the agreement between them was quantified.
- Action:

- Result: Signal distributions were obtaind with the data driven by bg sub-method. Tight isolation efficiencies and purities were measured. Data-MC agreements were estimated as shifts in the isolation distributions.
